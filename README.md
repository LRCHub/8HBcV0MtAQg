[00:18.52] First things first, rest in peace, Uncle Phil
[00:22.65] For real
[00:23.57] You the only father that I ever knew
[00:25.22] I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
[00:47.72] 
[00:27.85] Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
[00:32.26] Fulfilled
[00:33.03] Listen even back when we was broke, my team ill
[00:35.39] Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga
[01:07.89] 
[00:38.45] One time for my L.A. sisters
[00:41.09] One time for my L.A. hoes
[00:43.32] Lame niggas can't tell the difference
[00:45.94] One time for a nigga who knows
[01:00.94] 
[00:47.78] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[00:50.06] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[00:52.33] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[00:54.94] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[01:14.94] 
[00:57.78] No role models and I'm here right now
[01:00.15] No role models to speak up
[01:01.95] Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
[01:04.47] L.A.st night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
[01:35.97] 
[01:07.53] Not Trina, but I swear to god this bitch'll make you call your girl up
[01:10.41] And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
[01:11.72] Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
[01:13.94] Then hang the phone up, and proceed to L.A.y the wood
[01:40.44] 
[01:16.26] I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
[01:19.62] Ain't got no shame 'bout it
[01:21.13] She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
[01:23.43] I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
[01:52.43] 
[01:25.81] But then I thought back, back to a better me
[01:28.68] Before I was a B-list celebrity
[01:30.42] Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
[01:33.03] Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
[01:35.33] You wasn't sweatin' me
[01:46.33] 
[01:36.49] One time for my L.A. sisters
[01:38.46] One time for my L.A. hoes
[01:41.10] Lame niggas can't tell the difference
[01:43.35] One time for a nigga who knows
[01:58.35] 
[01:45.30] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[01:47.58] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[01:49.88] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[01:52.49] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[02:12.49] 
[01:54.70] I want a real love, dark skinned, and Aunt Viv' love
[01:57.84] That Jada and that Will love
[01:59.68] That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
[02:02.07] And you ain't gotta worry whether that's your kid love
[02:29.07] 
[02:04.67] Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
[02:07.42] Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
[02:09.45] Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
[02:11.82] Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the door, nigga you know how it goes
[02:44.32] 
[02:14.68] She deserved that, she a bird, that's a bird trap
[02:16.92] You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
[02:19.26] Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, before she leave
[02:21.88] "I'm a need my shirt back" (nigga, you know how it go)
[02:48.88] 
[02:24.13] One time for my L.A. sisters
[02:26.49] One time for my L.A. hoes

[02:37.87] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[02:40.29] Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[03:00.29] 
[02:43.22] There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas
[02:46.10] Probably in Tennessee that says, "Fool me once"
[02:49.92] Shame on, shame on you
[02:56.29] Fool me-, we can't get fooled again
[03:13.79] 
[02:57.87] Fool me one time, shame on you (hey)
[03:00.12] Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (hey)

[03:05.05] Load the chopper, let it rain on you
[03:23.05] 
[03:07.10] Fool me one time, shame on you (hey)
[03:09.42] Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (hey)

[03:16.44] My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
[03:18.73] My only regret was too young for Nia Long
